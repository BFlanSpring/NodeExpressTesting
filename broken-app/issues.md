# Broken App Issues
 
### Code Block 1 - Express Server

#### Description
The provided code for an Express server has several issues that need attention and fixing.

#### Issues Identified
1. **Mapping Over Async Functions**: Incorrect usage of `map` on an array of async functions (`axios.get`) without awaiting their resolution.
2. **Handling Async/Await with `map`**: Lack of utilization of `Promise.all` to properly await all promises instead of `map`.
3. **Error Handling**: Inadequate error handling within the `try/catch` block and missing the handling of the `err` parameter.
4. **Parsing Request Body**: Assuming `req.body.developers` is an array without ensuring its existence and type.
